# python_tkinter_Calculator
Python GUI experiment. Here you can find my Calculator app with tkinter module.

Please note that this app is also a good example how cool is the eval function to evaluate string to python expression.

the source of the icon: http://fontawesome.io/icon/calculator/
you can generate your own icons in the following site: http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-ico

I used http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/ site to find a nice colour combination for the design. I hope it helps if you need any colour design.


Thanks,
Mark
